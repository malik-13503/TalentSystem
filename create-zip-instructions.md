# Instructions for Creating a ZIP File for Deployment

## Option 1: Download from Replit

1. In the Replit sidebar, click on the "Files" tab.
2. Right-click on the project root folder.
3. Select "Download as ZIP".
4. This will download a ZIP file of your entire project.

## Option 2: Download Selected Files

If you want more control over what files are included, you can:

1. Click on the three dots (â‹®) in the Files panel.
2. Select "Download as ZIP".
3. This will download the entire project.

## Option A: Repository Setup with GitHub Desktop

1. Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) on your computer.
2. Create a new repository and initialize it with the project files you downloaded.
3. Publish the repository to GitHub.

## Option B: GitHub Web Interface

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in.
